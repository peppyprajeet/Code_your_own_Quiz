Programming Language starts with basic output, 'Hello __1__!'
In __2__ this is easy;
Syntax for this is: __3__ 'Hello __1__!'
In __2__ a function is created with __4__ keyword.""",


'medium':"""***Read the Paragraph and Fill in the blanks as needed***

A __1__ is created with the def keyword.
You specify the inputs a __1__ takes by adding __2__ separated by commas between the parentheses.
__1__s by default returns __3__ if you don't specify the value to retrun.
__2__ can be standard data types such as string, integer, dictionary, tuple,
and __4__ or can be more complicated such as objects and lambda functions.""",

Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that, according to Arthur Samuel in 1959,
gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

Evolved from the study of __1__ recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence,
machine learning explores the study and construction of __2__ that can learn from and make predictions
on data â€“ such __2__ overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,
through building a model from sample inputs.

Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming
explicit __2__ with good performance is difficult or unfeasible;example applications include email filtering,
detection of network intruders or __3__ insiders working towards a data breach,__4__ character recognition (OCR),learning to rank and computer vision.
